Hello! 

Includes Coordinator.c Checker.c Makefile and this README.

When I built HW2, I tried to divy up the work into logical processes for coordinating child and parend behavior. In this I modified all three of those functions to accomodate the new behavior, but had I started from scratch, I would have probable layed it out a bit differently - I hope its not too confusing to whoever reads this.

Thanks!
